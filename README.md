# Django + React eCommerce Project

* This eCommerce project was created to help me learn and practice Django framework with React. Though I have some experience with React, I will have the chance to learn Redux which is also very handy in terms of state management. I'm excited to get things started! Later on the process, we will use AWS S3 buckets and Paypal transaction API, and etc.


# Libraries Used

* React-Bootstrap: Container, Row, Col, LinkContainer, Nav, Navbar
* React-router-dom: Link, BrowerRouter, Route, Routes
* Redux: state control
